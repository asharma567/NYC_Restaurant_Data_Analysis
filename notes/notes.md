How does the grading system work?

Inspectors make unannounced visits to our cityâ€™s 24,000 or so restaurants at least once a year. The inspectors take the temperature of food, inspect how food is prepared and look for potential violations, such as evidence of vermin or dirty cooking utensils. Restaurants are given points based on the type and severity of a violation, and assigned a grade based on those points. The lower the score, the better.
