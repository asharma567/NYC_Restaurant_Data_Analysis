- do a quick check for anomalies. Use our tool!
- examine them
- plot frequency of violation
- flip the frequency
- Make it clear this is not to make a pervasive conclusion as the test assumes independence
Data is a compass: It's important not to act on this information alone. Use it for for direction for you next move, i.e. digging deeper as to why it's so.
- Significance as a wieght of believability

How does the chi-squared test work? what are the assumptions of the test?
i) sample size
ii) independence

For example it might be the case that either the inspections themselves are biased for/against certain cuisines based on the food, ingredients, refrigeration needs, restaurant turnover frequency, etc. like you mention.


Why do donuts get inspected the most? 

Out of the target set of resturants why do Uzbek get targeted the least?

What's the direction of the project?
